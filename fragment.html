                This agency can also coordinate the 
                second pressing need: a massive rollout of 
                COVID-19 tests. Those tests have been slow to 
                arrive because of five separate shortages:
                 of masks to protect people administering the
                  tests; of nasopharyngeal swabs for collecting
                  viral samples; of extraction kits for pulling 
                  the virus’s genetic material out of the samples; of chemical reagents that are part of those kits;
                 and of trained people who can give the tests.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of these shortages are, again, 
                due to strained supply chains. 
                The U.S. relies on three manufacturers
                 for extraction reagents, providing redundancy 
                 in case any of them fails—but all of them 
                 failed in the face of unprecedented global 
                 demand. Meanwhile, Lombardy, Italy, the 
                 hardest-hit place in Europe, houses one of 
                 the largest
                 manufacturers of nasopharyngeal swabs.
